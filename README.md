👋 Hi, I’m @DevilOPerG1! 

👀 I’m interested in developing projects and learning new technologies, especially Golang, Rust, and React. 

🌱 I’m learning more about effectively using my coding knowledge to build cool and useful things!

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting project ideas. We could combine our skills with Golang, Rust, or React to create a web app or explore something completely different! 

📫 How to reach me: DevilOPerG1@gmail.com

😄 Pronouns: Mr.

⚡ Fun fact: My ideas are like duct tape and superglue – messy, and unconventional, but they usually get the job done!
